# Hi, I'm Rod Claar 👋

**Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) | Principal Consultant | AI-Enhanced Agile Development Expert**

I teach developers and teams how to build better software faster using AI-enhanced Scrum methodology, Test-Driven Development, and modern AI tools.

With over 30 years in software development and nearly 20 years teaching Scrum, I'm now focused on helping development teams integrate AI into their workflows without losing the discipline and quality that make great software.

Most of my work is practical: real training workshops, tested patterns, and working examples for **AI-Enhanced Scrum**, **Test-First AI Development**, and **AI-powered automation tools** that help teams ship quality code faster.

I run **[AgileAIDev.com](https://AgileAIDev.com)**, where I offer training workshops, consulting services, and AI integration guidance for development teams and enterprises.

## What I Work On

* **AI-Enhanced Scrum Training**: Teaching teams how to integrate AI tools into Scrum workflows while maintaining quality and discipline

* **AI Tools for Developers**: Building practical applications like AI Architect (RAG-powered documentation automation), RAG Scraper, and PromptDatabase
* **Scrum Certification Courses**: CSM, CSPO, CSD, CSP-SM, CSP-PO, A-CSM, and A-CSPO workshops
